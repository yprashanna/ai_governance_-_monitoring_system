# AI Governance and Monitoring System

## Overview
The AI Governance and Monitoring System is designed to ensure that AI systems, particularly those in sensitive domains such as finance, law, and medicine, adhere to ethical guidelines during their interactions with users. The system monitors AI-generated responses in real-time, filtering them through a set of predefined rules to prevent unethical or harmful outputs.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** AI-generated responses are checked against domain-specific ethical rules in real-time.
- **Domain-Specific Rules:** The system includes predefined rules for the Finance, Law, and Medical domains, with the ability to add new rules dynamically.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive interface built using Streamlit, optimized for both end-users and trainers.
- **Trainer Interface:** Allows domain experts to easily add or modify rules to adapt to new ethical standards or domain-specific requirements.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit:** Used for building the interactive user interface.
- **GPT-Neo:** Powers the AI response generation, providing a balance between performance and interpretability.
- **Python:** The core programming language for the backend logic and rule management.

## Installation
